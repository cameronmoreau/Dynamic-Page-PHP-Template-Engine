	<h2>How does the internet work?</h2>
	<p>Before you go off and create your first website, it is a great idea to know 
		how the internet actually works. Imagine the internet as a giant wire; although 
		we sometimes see the internet transmitted wirelessly, it is still one huge wire. 
		This wire is great because it allows things called servers to communicate with 
		each other, just like we talk on the phone. A server is a special computer that 
		stores files and webpages, just like we would store music, photos, and documents 
		on our everyday home computer. These servers have a specific address called an 
		IP address which allows other servers to communicate to it such as 
		(72.14.205.100) or (69.63.176.140). But since humans tend to talk with words 
		rather than numbers unlike computers, these IP addresses link to something called 
		a domain name like (google.com) or (facebook.com). The computers that we use 
		every day are called clients since they are not connected directly to this "wire". 
		Since clients arenâ€™t directly connected, you may be wondering how we can 
		communicate to servers, the answer is an ISP or Internet Service Provider such as 
		ATT, Time Warner, or Comcast. An ISP is just like your phone provider, but an ISP 
		allows you to get in touch with this "wire". When you send an email or a server 
		sends a website to your computer, the data is transferred through the "wire" by 
		things called packets. Packets are break downs of information that can be put 
		back together like a puzzle when it reaches its destination. And how do these 
		packets flow to where you want them to go? This is done by routers and modems 
		which create a map of IP addresses for the information to follow.

	<h2>Websites and HTTP</h2>
	<p>The "www" that you may see when typing in a web address stands for the 
		World Wide Web which is "wire" that makes the internet work. Websites transfer 
		through the internet using a protocol called HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer 
		Protocol. When we type a web address in our browser, we are really sending a 
		command to the server to transfer the webpages we would like to view. Another 
		big part of the internet is the W3C or World Wide Web Consortium. You can
		think of this organization as the police of the internet. The W3C setup "laws" 
		and standard organization for the World Wide Web so that things don't get out 
		of hand.
